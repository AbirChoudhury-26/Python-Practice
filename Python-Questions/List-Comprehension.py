# A Python list comprehension consists of brackets containing the expression, which is executed for each element along with the for loop to iterate over each element in the Python list. 

# Example-1

numbers = [12, 13, 14,] 
doubled = [x *2 for x in numbers] 
print(doubled)

# Example-2 

list = [i for i in range(11) if i % 2 == 0] 
print(list)

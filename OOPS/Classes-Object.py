# __init__() method
# The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initializing the objectâ€™s state. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. It runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.

# Sample class with init method
class Person:

	# init method or constructor
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name

	# Sample Method
	def say_hi(self):
		print('Hello, my name is', self.name)


p = Person('Nikhil')
p.say_hi()
